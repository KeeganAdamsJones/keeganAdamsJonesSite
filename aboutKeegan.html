        <div class="about-statement">
            <p>
            I am a recent graduate, earning a Bachelor of Science degree with a focus on
            software development. I also have a degree in fine art. My education combined 
            with experience in management and customer service give me an excellent foundation 
            to launch my new career in software or web development.
            </p>

            <p>
            I love to design and create new things.  Finding innovative solutions to problems 
            drives me, whether I am building something with my hands or solving a challenge in 
            software development.  I have a passion for learning and really enjoy working alone 
            and in team environments. 
            </p>

            <p>
            My desire and determination to learn helped me to earn a 4.0 gpa upon graduation. 
            I have continued to challenge myself to code on my own time.  I believe that 
            mindfulness and balance are key in both work and home life.  I have 3 amazing kids, 
            love to make art, garden, read, travel and spend time outdoors.  
            </p>

            <p>
            I am currently seeking employment as an entry level software or web developer.  
            I can\'\t wait to start my new career, put my skills to work and to continue learning 
            and growing in the industry.
            </p>
