                <p>
                    Marjorie Schick was an amazing artist, teacher and woman.  The sheer amount of work that she did, 
                    all of the beautiful things that she created, is simply amazing.  Mrs. Schick had such a striking 
                    blend of boldness and gentleness.  She was very professional while remaining kind and warm.  She 
                    had a huge career, but I would argue that it was all of the little things that made her so special.  
                    Anyone who knew her, surely remembers her genuine excitement for the creativity that she found all 
                    around herself; in her students work, the work of her colleagues, and even in everyday objects.  
                    She truly appreciated thoughtful design.  Mrs. Schick took notice of every little detail in her 
                    world. The huge support she showed her students was built daily with consistent little encouragements 
                    along the way.  She taught us to never neglect to finish the back of a piece of our work, to respond 
                    to the calls for artists and to apply to be in the book! She showed us that the big impact you make 
                    on the world is created by the small decisions you make everyday…work, work, work and keep records 
                    for everything!  Though she had created in impressive international reputation, she remained in her 
                    small Kansas town and maintained a humble heart.   Marjorie Schick worked in her studio on the third 
                    floor of Porter Hall at Pittsburg State University for 50 years, attending to every little detail of 
                    her large-scale sculptures for the body, and inspiring individual students in many small but significant 
                    ways.. she made a great impact on those around her and I am thankful to have known her.

                    My best memory of her was, “Probably the first day of class with her.  She was dramatically adorned with the biggest and boldest jewelry I had ever seen with an accompanying head of bright red hair.  You could feel her excitement and passion for the field of art jewelry from the moment you met her.  It was always inspiring.”

                    I have many great memories with her, but one of the sweetest ones was the way that she welcomed me at her “50 + 50 = 100” lecture at PSU in 2017.  I had not seen her in probably 10 years and she was so very warm and genuinely glad to see that I came.  She hugged me and gave me one of her books, “Sculpture to Wear.”  She was special, so loving and warm and welcoming.

                    She taught all of us to just keep working, don’t make excuses.  At her retirement lecture, she mentions having to work in a very small kitchen where they lived for a time, so she worked in paper mache because that is what she could do in the space she had.
